/**
 * Ensure goal start/target weights are coherent with the chosen deficit/surplus direction.

 * We infer goal type from `dailyDeficit`:
 * - dailyDeficit > 0 => target must be lower than start (weight loss)
 * - dailyDeficit < 0 => target must be higher than start (weight gain)
 * - dailyDeficit === 0 => no ordering constraint (maintenance)
 *
 * Returns a user-facing error message, or `null` when the goal definition is coherent.
